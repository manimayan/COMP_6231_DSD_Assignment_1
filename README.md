## About The Project

### Distributed Class Management System (DCMS) using Java RMI - Assignment 1

### Outline
In the assignments and project, you are going to implement a simple Distributed Class Management System: a distributed system used by center managers to manage 
information regarding the teachers and students across different centers.

In this assignment, you are going to develop this application using Java RMI.
Specifically, do the following:

➲ Write the Java RMI interface definition for the CenterServer with the specified 
operations. 

➲ Implement the CenterServer. 

➲ Design and implement a ManagerClient, which invokes the center’s server system to test the correct operation of the DCMS invoking multiple CenterServer (each of 
the servers initially has a few records) and multiple managers.
 
You should design the CenterServer maximizing concurrency. In other words, use proper synchronization that allows multiple police manager to perform operations for the same or different records at the same time.
